See .html and .py for instructions.

The .html file logs you into Google and generates an id token to send
to your server-side/backend.

The .py receives the id token and checks with the goog api that
it's valid, and you get a user id.

To deploy this, you will need:

1. Your Client ID: sdfsfsf-sfdsdfsdfsdf.apps.googleusercontent.com
